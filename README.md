 # Housing Price Prediction – Multiple Linear Regression
This repository contains a complete implementation of Multiple Linear Regression to predict housing prices using the Housing dataset. The project walks through preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and feature interpretation using common machine learning tools in Python.
Objectives
Build a regression model to predict house prices.

Understand the impact of various house features on price.

Preprocess data by encoding categorical variables.

Evaluate model performance using regression metrics.

Visualize feature importance using model coefficients.

Tools Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Google Colab (for interactive execution and file upload)

Features of This Project
1. Data Preprocessing
One-hot encoding for categorical variables.

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. Model Training
Fitting a LinearRegression model using scikit-learn.

Training the model on 80% of the data.

3. Model Evaluation
Calculation of Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Calculation of Mean Squared Error (MSE).

R² Score for model performance.

4. Feature Importance
Display of regression coefficients for all features.

Visualization of feature influence using a horizontal bar chart.

How to Use
Open the .ipynb notebook in Google Colab or any Jupyter environment.

Upload the Housing.csv dataset when prompted.

Run each code cell sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and view outputs.

Prerequisites
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed (already included in Google Colab):

pandas

numpy

sklearn

matplotlib

Dataset Source
This project uses a housing dataset that contains various features such as number of bedrooms, area, bathrooms, and amenities to predict house prices. The dataset should be uploaded in CSV format.
